THE FRAMES HTML:-
As it is a merging of all the html files made, we need to keep in mind the layout and the font size and design of the page.For example, we can do these;
  - adding buttons in the navigation bar where menu of home, about us,and other info is given.
  - we can divide the left frame contents in a more better design by using <hr> tag.
  - change the images to more capturing ones that speak about delhi and gives us a more detailed view of the capital.
